					<h3>Getting started helping students and debugging</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Debugging can be tricky - but there are a few things that you can do to improve
						your own bug hunting skills, as well as help new programmers adequately read and understand the
						error messages they're receiving.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="debug_info">
					<p class="fragment">The first step in debugging code is simply figuring out <i>what</i> the problem
						is. Sometimes this is obvious - the error message will point to a specific line of the program,
						and if you look at the error description and the line of code it's pointing to, you can often
						see the problem.</p>
					<p class="fragment">But not always. Sometimes the line that triggered the problem is simply the
						first place where a flaky value produced elsewhere gets used in an invalid way.</p>
					<p class="fragment">To successfully debug a program, we first need to know what type of error we're
						receiving to know what we need to do to fix it.</p>
					<p class="fragment">With JavaScript, most of our errors fit into two categories: syntax errors and
						runtime errors.</p>
				</section>

			</section>

			<section class="syntax_errors">

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
					<p class="fragment">The most common source of errors for new programmers is syntax errors.</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						A syntax error is a problem with the grammar in our code. Syntax errors mostly come in the form
						of misspelled keywords, missing or open brackets, or missing parentheses or punctuation
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">Let's look at a few examples of syntax errors</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Example 1</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p data-id="code-title">A students CSS is not being pulled in to their application, and they're
						receiving the following error in their console:</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="./assets/ss33.png">
					<p class="fragment">So where do you go from here? Since we know that the CSS file is not being
						imported
						correctly, we can ask ourselves the following things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">What is the name of the CSS file?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Where do we reference the CSS file in the code, and does the code match the
							file name iteself?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When working with syntax errors, it's extremely important to read line-by-line, letter-by-letter,
						and to cross reference for any discrepancies.
					</p>
					<div class="sideBySide">
						<div class="fragment">
							<img src="./assets/ss35.png">
							<p class="blurb">Looking at our files, we can see that our CSS file is named
								<i>styles.css</i>.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We can now cross reference our code to make sure what we're importing matches our file named
						<i>styles.css</i></p>
					<pre class="fragment" data-id="code-animation"><code class="html" data-trim data-line-numbers="5">
						&lt;head&gt;
						  <meta charset="UTF-8">
						  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
						  <title>Interview</title>
						  <link type='text/css' rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
						&lt;/head&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Notice on line 5, where we're referencing our CSS file, that we have a typo -
						our file name and import of that file do not match. Typos are extremely easy to overlook, so
						again, be sure to read line-by-line & character-by-character!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Example 2</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p data-id="code-title">A student asks you to look at the following block of code, as they are
						receiving some errors and not getting the output they expect:</p>
					<pre class="fragment" data-id="code-animation"><code class="JavaScript" data-trim data-line-numbers="">
						function displayEvenNumbers() {
						  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
						  let evenNumbers = [];
						  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++;) {
						    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
						      evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
						    }
						  return evenNumbers;
						}
						
						let returnValue = displayEvenNumbers(); // should return [2,4,6,8]
						console.log(returnValue);
					</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section class="example_two">
					<p>Although Visual Studio Code is extremely helpful and will point out some snytax errors in the
						code, that's not always the case. Syntax errors - especially in larger blocks of code - are very
						easy to overlook, so always have students run their code for you as a starting point so you can
						see what errors they are receiving.</p>
					<p class="fragment">When running the code block from the previous slide, we're presented with the
						following error message:</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="./assets/ss38.png">
					<p class="fragment">Notice that we are receiving a syntax error - we have an unexpected token of ';'
						at the end of the for loop.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="example_two_breakdown">
					<p>Lets break down the above error message in a bit more detail:</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="./assets/ss38_ed.png">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">1.) This is the relative path of the file where the code is breaking. The
							number at the end of the path (4 in this case), denotes the line in which the code is
							actually breaking.</li>
						<li class="fragment">2.) This shows us the actual line of code that is breaking. Notice the
							carrot (^) at the end of the loop - this denotes the problem that was identified in the
							code.</li>
						<li class="fragment">3.) This line tells us what type of error we received (syntax error in this
							case), and what that syntax error is - we have an unexpected token of ';'.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment">Putting together the information we gathered above from the error message, we
						now know that we have a syntactical error of unexpected token on line 4 of our code, and the
						unexpected token we're looking for is a semi-colon ';' at the end of our for loop. If we go back
						to our code now, we should know exactly where to look to fix the error.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<pre class="fragment" data-id="code-animation"><code class="JavaScript" data-trim data-line-numbers="4">
						function displayEvenNumbers() {
						  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
						  let evenNumbers = [];
						  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++;) {
						    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
						      evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
						    }
						  return evenNumbers;
						}
						
						let returnValue = displayEvenNumbers(); // should return [2,4,6,8]
						console.log(returnValue);
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Just like our error message said, we have have an unexpected token of ';' at the
						end of the for loop - so let's take that out. After fixing an error, always re-run the code to
						make sure there are no additional errors.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="example_two_continued">
					<p>After re-running the code, we're still receiving an error:</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="./assets/ss43.png">
					<p class="fragment">Unfortunately, this error message doesn't give us a lot of information. The
						error message we're receiving says that the error is coming from our console.log statement -
						even though everything is structured correctly and we're referencing a valid variable. We can
						now follow the reverse chain of events to narrow down where exactly the problem is coming from:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Error is coming from console.log statement</li>
						<li class="fragment">console.log statement is referencing a valid variable</li>
						<li class="fragment">Since the variable being referenced is valid, we need to go look at the
							variable itself. The variable of 'returnValue' holds the call to the function of
							displayEvenNumbers() - pointing us to the function as the cause of the problem - we now know
							the problem is within the function itself.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class="fragment">Alternatively, we can also check out the PROBLEMS tab for any useful
						information:</p>
					<img src="./assets/ss44.png" alt="VS Code PROBLEMS tab" class="fragment">
					<p class="fragment">This gives us a bit more information as to what the problem within the function
						actually is. The error we receieved was, "The parser expected to find a '}' to match the '{'
						token here" - which tells us that we're missing a closing curly brace.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="example_two_fix">
					<p>Looking back at our code, we can now double check each instance of our opening curly braces to
						make sure we have a closing curly brace to match, starting with the outermost scoped body:</p>
					<pre class="fragment" data-id="code-animation"><code class="JavaScript" data-trim data-line-numbers="1,9|4|5,7">
						function displayEvenNumbers() {
						  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
						  let evenNumbers = [];
						  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++;) {
						    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
						      evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
						    }
						  return evenNumbers;
						}
						
						let returnValue = displayEvenNumbers(); // should return [2,4,6,8]
						console.log(returnValue);
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Notice that we're missing a closing curly brace for the for loop. This is also
						where the structure of the code is extremely important - it's much easier to spot missing
						brackets or braces if the code is structured properly.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Including a closing curly brace for the for loop will successfully debug the
						code.</p>

					<h3>Additional Debug Information</h1>
				</section>

				<section class="additonal_tips">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Have students properly structure the code so it's easy to read and understand.</li>
						<li class="fragment">It’s possible for a program to run without throwing an obvious error, but still contain logic errors which cause it to behave differently than expected. Often these kinds of errors are more subtle and harder to identify. One key strategy is to insert extra console.log statements at various points in the program to find out what the program is doing at each point.</li>
						<li class="fragment">We often see students try to write the whole solution in one go, and then get stuck because they’ve got a number of different errors in their program at the same time.
							Encourage students to build their solution step by step, running their program each time they add a new piece. This way, if their program stops working, they know the culprit was the last piece that was added and where to look for issues in the code.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Also called rubber duck debugging, this technique has you or the student explain what the code is doing line-by-line to each other or an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) - this is especially helpful for students when they don't have someone to walk through their code with them. The idea is that the process of describing each line of the program explicitly helps the describer pay closer attention to small details and assumptions, and can help them see solutions that they missed before.</li>
