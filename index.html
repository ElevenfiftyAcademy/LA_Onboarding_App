					<h3>Getting started helping students and debugging</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Debugging can be tricky - but there are a few things that you can do to improve
						your own bug hunting skills, as well as help new programmers adequately read and understand the
						error messages they're receiving.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="debug_info">
					<p class="fragment">The first step in debugging code is simply figuring out <i>what</i> the problem
						is. Sometimes this is obvious - the error message will point to a specific line of the program,
						and if you look at the error description and the line of code it's pointing to, you can often
						see the problem.</p>
					<p class="fragment">But not always. Sometimes the line that triggered the problem is simply the
						first place where a flaky value produced elsewhere gets used in an invalid way.</p>
					<p class="fragment">To successfully debug a program, we first need to know what type of error we're
						receiving to know what we need to do to fix it.</p>
					<p class="fragment">With JavaScript, most of our errors fit into two categories: syntax errors and
						runtime errors.</p>
				</section>

			</section>

			<section class="syntax_errors">

				<section>
					<h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
					<p class="fragment">The most common source of errors for new programmers is syntax errors.</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						A syntax error is a problem with the grammar in our code. Syntax errors mostly come in the form
						of misspelled keywords, missing or open brackets, or missing parentheses or punctuation
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">Let's look at a few examples of syntax errors</p>
				</section>

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p data-id="code-title">E.g. A students CSS is not being pulled in to their application, and they're
						receiving the following error in their console:</p>
					<img class="fragment" src="./assets/ss33.png">
					<p class="fragment">So where do you go from here? Since we know that the CSS file is not being
						imported
						correctly, we can ask ourselves the following things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">What is the name of the CSS file?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Where do we reference the CSS file in the code, and does the code match the
							file name iteself?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When working with syntax errors, it's extremely important to read line-by-line, letter-by-letter,
						and to cross reference for any discrepancies.
					</p>
					<div class="sideBySide">
						<div class="fragment">
							<img src="./assets/ss35.png">
							<p class="blurb">Looking at our files, we can see that our CSS file is named <i>styles.css</i>.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We can now cross reference our code to make sure what we're importing matches our file named <i>styles.css</i></p>
					<pre class="fragment" data-id="code-animation"><code class="html" data-trim data-line-numbers="5">
						&lt;head&gt;
						  <meta charset="UTF-8">
						  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
						  <title>Interview</title>
						  <link type='text/css' rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
						&lt;/head&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Notice on line 5, where we're referencing our CSS file, that we have a typo - our file name and import of that file do not match. Typos are extremely easy to overlook, so again, be sure to read line-by-line & character-by-character!</p>
